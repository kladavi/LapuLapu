- **2026-03-26 — Incident Review Meeting** #raw
  - Applications that do not have batch jobs running can be patched on Thursday night, instead of waiting for the weekend when other Releases and upgrades are prioritized.  This will relieve some pressure on the weekend schedule.

- **2026-03-26 — New Relic Monitoring (GOCC) Meeting** #processed
  - **Source:** GOCC-20260326 - New Relic Monitoring-260326-035913.pdf
  - **Attendees:** IS and ETS teams
  - **Focus:** Japan-based observability, dashboard delivery, and GOCC operating model
  - **Key outcomes:**
    1. Confirmed objective: Japan-based observability for Employee Experience and Developer Experience
    2. Two consolidated dashboards in scope (Employee Experience — production; Developer Experience — non-production)
    3. 16 applications transitioned from PS monitoring to GOCC; long-term goal to onboard all systems
    4. ePOS deep-dive: runs on AKS, monitored via New Relic APM, aligns to OMM Level 3
    5. PS team performs daily manual health checks via Manulink batch script (contacts: Nakatsu-san, Yamamoto-san, Murata-san)
    6. ePOS has ~17 non-prod environments; not currently in daily non-prod monitoring alert email from TEM — gap acknowledged
    7. GOCC monitoring requires service account with key-based authentication through Manulink
    8. Offloading opportunities: certificate renewals (already automated), SPN renewals (Managed Identity + federated creds), service account password management (vaulting)
    9. ePOS environment/DB management is ad hoc; opportunity for on-demand enablement and automated refresh
    10. GOCC delivery model agreed: URL availability → APM → Rapid Recovery; CMDB relationships must stay current

- **2026-03-17 — Patching Schedule and Possible Standard BAU Transition** #processed
  - **Source:** Minutes of the Meeting_ Patching Schedule and Possible Standard BAU Transition.eml
  - **From:** Karen L Escalona (Global Asia CM)
  - **Attendees:** Karen Escalona, Shunsuke Miura (JP CAB), Manoj Kondody (P2G Lead), Sreekanth Dogiparthy (Windows Lead), Birger Fjaellman (JP HOT), Naoki Tada (JP CAB), Kanagaraj Ramasamy (Linux Lead), Hideo Hasegawa (JP IT Operation and Risk)
  - **Focus:** Patching activity conflicts with Japan project releases; identification of changes for Standard BAU transition
  - **Key outcomes:**
    1. Weekday patching for Japan is challenging for ETS — manpower/resource splitting across windows and lack of end-to-end Ansible automation
    2. Birger's team working on allocating engineers so batch operations are not impacted during patching
    3. Recommendation to simplify and document patching process so GOCC can execute, reducing ETS dependency
    4. Kanagaraj to prepare documentation outlining patching challenges and end-to-end process
    5. Standard template for Japan Production Servers to be prepared; Kanagaraj and Sreekanth to share updated Linux/Windows prod server lists with Hideo-san for application name mapping
    6. Karen to schedule follow-up with HK and Indonesia representatives for non-production environments
